                <p>Alright, what's happening?</p>
                <p>I just started the final semester of my legally required educational career. In a little over three months I'll be walking across that stage... for precisely 3 seconds, that is. All jokes aside this is and forever will be one of the largest stepping stones in my life, and I'm not just saying that. My entire life I've always felt like the "kid", either they were older than me and thus superior, or they were just stupid kids. But now, that's changed. I'm currently the oldest in my school and it's definitely strange. I'm not gonna get all hubby dubby and whatnot, this is a now page not a memoir, but, if you are curious to learn, more do read my <a href="/about/">about page</a>.</p>
                
                <br>
                <p>And now the usuals:</p>

                
                <h3>I've been reading: <i>Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?</i></h3>
                <p>Wonderful read that I cannot do justice in this short blurb. Watched the film dozens of times and decided to pick up the novel, it has not disappointed!</p>

                <br>
                <h3>I've been listening to: Mixed things</h3>
                <p>My music has been a mixed bag recently. Been listening to a particular playlist including but not limited to: Bob Dylan, Coldplay, Ozzy Osbourne (the Ozzy-Rhandy tribute album has been particularly listened to), and a few scathered others.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>I've been playing: <i>Minecraft</i></h3>
                <p>Yup, nothing else to report on this one. I've been playing mostly on my 1.12.2 survival world, though occasionally on a 1.21.4 server with a few buddies of mine.</p>
