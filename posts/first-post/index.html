            <p>So, the first post...</p>

<p>Y'know, this is kinda strange. This is the first piece of writing that is being put out under "my" name (even though it's clearly not my actual name) with the prospect of almost nobody viewing its contents for possibly years. Well, all bloggs need blogging, even if unviewed. So even if you are reading this from the distant future, I think I'll tell you a little about how this site came to be.</p>

<p>I think the best place to start would be with me. Hi! You can call me Pigeon, and I'm your local administrator here at TheCoup. I'm in high school working on my computer science skills, and plan on going to college for, you guessed it, computer science. Specifically I plan on getting my bachalors in cybersecurity and/or I.T.</p>

<p>Now, on to the juicy questions! I created this website using an online service known as <a href="https://www.neocities.org" target="_blank">Neocities</a>. It's this amazing FOSS project that aspires to bring back the glory days of the internet by offering free web hosting for anyone. I did this for two main reasons, the former more important in my eyes than the latter; 1. to be able to freely express myself and associated opinions without the mindless guidance of of a multi-billion dollar coorparation, and 2. to offer up my computing power for good. To properly gauge the scope of what I'm reffering to, we must delve deeper.</p>

<p>As S.G. Tallentyre once wrote, "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it". More than ever is this quote relavent. We are, unfortunately, quickly approaching a world where altering opinions are null and void. If you try to share your thoughts that even remotely differ from the mass on a major social platform, you are essentially exiled from that social platform, whether by the aforementioned multi-billion dollar faceless coorparations or the actual public themselves. That is why I created this; to freely share myself and my thoughts without being herded by these giant shepards. And, perhaps, you reading this, whether from the close or distant future, will inspire you to pick up the sword and shield of the written word, to freely express you without the breath of the iron giants looming over. Give <a href="https://www.neocities.org" target="_blank">Neocities</a> a try.</p>

<p>Wooh! That took a turn for the slightly melodramatic. Let's move on!</p>

<p>Right, the second reason for the creation of this website; using my computing power for good. You see, another thing about these multi-billion dollar coorparation is that, well, they're coorparations, buisnesses. They don't really care too much about their customer's happiness, they just want to make more money. That seems all fine and dandy on surface value, that's what a buisness <i>is</i> afterall. But, these buisnesses are... how do I say... malicious. No, they are not bad people individually, but their meathods aren't the greatest. Take the almighty Google, for example. Depending on who you are, you probably used Google to access this page... 10 times over. You might have an Android phone, which means you probably use Chrome, which probably means you used Google to search for this site, and on and on and on.</p>

<p>As you might see, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. have a huge amount of control over you and what content you see. That is where we must help each other unilaterally. By using alternative services like <a href="https://github.com/searx/searx" target="_blank">SearX</a>, you control what you see. But, because these big companies want nothing to do with "freedom", it is up to the people, the citizens of the internet, to do these acts themselves. That is why, here on TheCoup, we put freedom first. All freedom-first services are avalible <a href="/services.html">here</a> or by clicking the "Services" button on the upper-right-hand corner.</p>

<p>Well, you've reached the end. I don't know if all of this will actually turn into anything significant, but who knows. The fog of the future is uncertain. But, until next time,</p>
<p>This is Pigeon. 73</p>
