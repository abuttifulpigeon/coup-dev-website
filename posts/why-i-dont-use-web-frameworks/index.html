<p>I'll just get straight to the point: I don't like web frameworks. In my experience, all they have done is overcomplicate, overcrowd, and generally bloat up projects, usually leading me to find an easier solution using plain-old HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. This led me to an interesting question; why do so many people shill and make it a point to use a web framework for every project, even when it feels unnecessary?</p>

<p>To tackle this problem we first need to look at the source; what is a web framework, and what was it designed to do? Well, firstly, a web framework is tool or package of tools usually used by a web developer to help them build a website more efficiently. However, the problem here is that 90% of internet sites are not huge megacorporation services like Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc, but rather smaller sites like your local church, food pantry, plumber, or blog site; ones that don't require complicated functions like the bigger ones do.</p>

<p>The reality is, frameworks can offer some conveniencesâ€”things like routing, state management, and component reuse. But for small to medium-sized projects, especially those that don't require complex features, using a full-blown framework often feels like bringing a tank to a knife fight. The added layers of abstraction and opinionated structures can slow you down, obscure your understanding of what's actually happening under the hood, and create headaches during debugging.</p>

<p>I get it: frameworks are popular because they make large-scale applications more manageable and scalable. But that's just it: large projects. If your project doesn't need all that power, there's no reason to force it. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have come a long way, and you can often achieve the same results with fewer dependencies, more control, and cleaner code.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it's about knowing your tools. Sometimes the simpler solution is the better one.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
