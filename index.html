                <h1>Hey, I'm Jonah!</h1>   

                <p>Welcome to <strong>TheCoup</strong>! Please, make yourself comfortable. This is just a little sclice of the internet I decided to occupy to build a space of my own, away from the coorperate shills and social norms of traditional social media.</p>

                <h2>Who are you?</h2>
                <p>As stated before, my name's Jonah, I'm from the northeast United States, right in the heart of New England!</p>
                <p>My biggest interests are amateur radio (of which, I am a licensed operator), radios in general (this also includes listening in on the police/fire/EMS scanner and ATC frequencies), programming, web development, cryptography, anything computer-esc aswell as fire departments, trains, aviation, and much else. If you can't tell already, I'm a huge nerd, a childish one in some regard. But hey, what're you gonna do? You like what you like.</p>

                <h2>What's happening <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank" id="now">now</a>?</h2>
                <p>I started my senior year of high school back in August, well, it was the 30th, so it may as well have been September. I already have plans and have applied to my university of choice, so that will be an exciting adventure in a little under a year. I've also started my first formal job, I'm helping the business my mother works at create a new website because the original one was, in their own words, "not good".</p>

                <p>As stated above, I am an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">amateur radio operator</a>, in fact I only got my license back in May. I'd like to keep saying I <i>just</i> got it, however the 6 month mark has already been surpassed, so I realistically now have to say just "I got my license". Anyway, with all this, I've done something I wouldn't normally do, however my passion for this is strong, so, I've started a club; the Amateur Radio Club, of course! We're currently very small, with only about two active members excluding me, however I am forseeing it to grow in the near future... hopefully anyway.</p>

                <p>Feel free to check out my <a href="/posts">blog</a>, as that's where you'll hear about me and my interests most, or my <a href="/about">about page</a> if you want to know a bit more about me, specifically.</p>
