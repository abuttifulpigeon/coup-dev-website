                <h1>Hey, I'm Jonah!</h1>   

                <p>Welcome to <strong>TheCoup</strong>! Please, make yourself comfortable. This is just a little sclice of the internet I decided to occupy to build a space of my own, away from the coorperate shills and social norms of traditional social media.</p>

                <h2>Who are you?</h2>
                <p>As stated before, my name's Jonah, I'm from the northeast United States, right in the heart of New England!</p>
                <p>My biggest interests are amateur radio (of which, I am a licensed operator), radios in general (this also includes listening in on the police/fire/EMS scanner and ATC frequencies), programming, web development, cryptography, anything computer-esc aswell as fire departments, trains, aviation, and much else. If you can't tell already, I'm a huge nerd, a childish one in some regard. But hey, what're you gonna do? You like what you like.</p>

                <p>Feel free to check out my <a href="/posts">blog</a>, as that's where you'll hear about me and my interests most, or my <a href="/about">about page</a> if you want to know a bit more about me, specifically.</p>
