<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Me in a nutshell</h2>
<p>I'm just another person here, really. I live in Massachusetts with my parents, siblings, and cat. I am a defender of Christ and do tech things.</p>

<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
<p><strong>Amateur radio!</strong> Callsign KC1UTV. Got my Technician license back in May 2024, my General in November, and have been hooked ever since. If you are also a Ham and are interested in making a QSO, <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>! If not, <a href="https://wiki.kidsontheair.net/doku.php?id=getting-started:what_is_ham_radio" target="_blank">get on that</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Programming!</strong> Usual spiel here. I enjoy creating stuff, whether it's a game, website, or tool. Currently messing with advanced web dev technologies (Vue.js in particular).</p>

<p><strong>Motorsports!</strong> Nothing much to say here. I'm always watching the current weekend's NASCAR and Formula 1 races (making me somewhat depressed in the winter), and have a unique enjoyment for monster trucks (I'm not childish, you're childish!)</p>

<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>Well, I'm still in high school so I don't have too much professional experience. However I am currently working as a web developer for a local hair salon. Otherwise, in September 2025 I'll be starting a degree in Cybersecurity!</p>
