        <p>So, you want to know a little more about me, eh? Well, whether you're an employer looking to see if I'm a good candidite for a job, a casual enjoyer of my content, or an axe murderer looking to destroy me and everyone I love, then I believe you've come to the right spot!
        </p>

        <h1>Me in 10 seconds:</h1>
        <p>You can call me Pigeon, I'm an upperclassman in high school, and am from the Northeast United States. I am a huge computer nerd and enjoy programming in my free time. I have a condition known as AMC that limits me to a wheelchair, but miraculously I have no mental impairments.</p>

        <h1>Me in 10 minutes:</h1>
        <p>So, where to begin? Well, the best part to start should be about me; My name's Pigeon, and I'm a Junior in high school, having been born in Boston, Massachussets in good ol' New England. I come from an, albeit large, family, with my mother being a hair dresser and my father a CNA, along with 6 others that I am not going to tell you about or we will never be finished here (sorry guys). From a young age, I've had a deep fascination and innate curiosity about technology, cars, and, well, anything with a power source. If it operated under it's own power, I was all about it.</p>
        
        <p>I am a self-proclaimed huge computer nerd, and I absolutely love coding and programming during my free time. There's something incredibly satisfying and rewarding about being able to create something tangible and functional through nothing but a standard QWERTY keyboard and a text editor, while using your own logic, creativity, and knowledge as your chisel. I find the process of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components and then piecing together elegant solutions to be an exhilarating intellectual challenge, as well as a good way to keep your mind moving.</p>
        
        <p>Now, something you must know before we continue is that I am not entirely physically normal. My physical mobility is limited due to a condition known as Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita (AMC), which confines me to the use of a wheelchair, I am incredibly fortunate thanks to a <i>certain</i> Man upstairs that my cognitive abilities and mental faculties remain unimpaired. AMC is a rare congenital disorder that affects the development of joints and muscles, leading to multiple joint contractures and decreased range of motion (you can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrogryposis_multiplex_congenita">here</a>). Despite the physical challenges posed by this condition, I've never allowed it to define or limit my aspirations or pursuit of knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>From an early age, most likely due to my almost never-ending proximity to computers with being in the hospital for extended periods, my parents recognized my insatiable curiosity and aptitude for technology. They, alongside my elemenary school's SPED department, supported and nurtured my interests, providing me with access to various educational resources and opportunities to explore. I vividly remember the day they gifted me with my first computer for Christmas. It was this tiny, 32GB HP notebook that ran like absolute crap on Windows 10, but little 10-year-old me didn't care, NOPE! The sheer excitement and wonder that consumed me as I opened up that lid for the very first time, listening to Cortana say her whole shpeel, shaped the rest of my life forever.</p>

        <p>Now, a while after this, I threw away that Notebook and got a new, slightly better, laptop. It came with Windows 10 again (like they all do), but it felt different this time. Learning to program on an already underpowered machine running a pretty bloated OS wasn't working, it was slow, couldn't run complex programs, and was just an overall bad experience. That was when I had heard of a different way. I had heard of it's existence previously, but never gave it much thought as it was foreign to me, coupled with everyone I asked about it saying it was too complicated. And, I think at this point, you know exactly what I'm talking, so let's all say it together. OpenBSD- no, I'm just kidding, GNU/Linux.</p>

        <p>With a new door unlocked, everything thereon changed. My first distro, or distrobution if you're not a Linux connoisseur, was POP_OS! Despite the fact that GNOME was and is higher in bloat than most other desktop environments, it pales in comparison to the bloat of a typical Windows installation, kickstarting my laptop, which, mind you, had already been a few years old, to new speeds I had never before seen on it. This opened up so much more, not just for that tiny laptop, but set the course for what I would be using for the foreseable future.
        </p>
        
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, that is K-11 as of writing, I've consistently excelled in subjects related to computer science, mathematics, and logical reasoning (a little less-so on that second one), and utterly sucked at everything else. My teachers and mentors have always commented on my ability to grasp concepts with remarkable ease and my unwavering determination to push the boundaries of my understanding.</p>
        
        <p>In my pursuit of programming prowess, I've acquired proficiency in a diverse array of programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML+CSS+JavaScript, C/C++, Rust, Bash, and the list goes on! Each language presents its own unique challenges and nuances, but I relish the opportunity to expand my repertoire and adapt to new paradigms. I find immense satisfaction in the process of crafting elegant, efficient, and robust code that not only solves the problem at hand but also adheres to industry best practices and coding standards.</p>
        
        <p>One of the aspects I find most captivating about programming is its versatility and applicability across a wide range of domains. From developing cutting-edge software applications and interactive websites to exploring the realms of data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and, let's be honest, finding the best GPU price during a solar eclipse, the possibilities are <i>virtually</i> endless. I am constantly in awe of the rapid pace of technological advancement and the ways in which programming continues to shape and revolutionize our world.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to my passion for coding, I also have a mad level of respect for our first responders. Especially today, we heed to embrace and be thankful that we live in a world that gives us protection and medicine on a scale at which we've never seen in human history. I also enjoy monster trucks and NASCAR, but that's not the point right now! I firmly believe in maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle and pursuing diverse interests, as they not only foster personal growth but also provide fresh perspectives and inspiration that can be translated into my endeavors.</p>
        
        <p>Despite the challenges posed by my physical condition, I've never allowed it to dampen my spirits or curtail my ambitions. In fact, it has instilled in me a deep sense of resilience, determination, and a unwavering drive to overcome obstacles and push beyond perceived limitations. While I could say that "with the right mindset, dedication, and support, any obstacle can be surmounted, and any dream can be realized", that's tacky as hell and, being honest, not true. Y'know, I'm gonna make a post about that. Consider it a continuation of the about page, stay tuned!</p>
            
        <p>As far as my future is concerned, I'm not entirely sure yet. I am planning to go to university for computer science, but after that I'm not sure about! I don't really have a "dream" job or place to work at, so I'm just gonna keep looking and see what presents itself to me.</p>
        
        <p>At the core of my being, I am a lifelong learner, a problem-solver, and a relentless explorer of the digital frontier. The world is a vast and ever-evolving landscape, and I am eager to continue my journey, constantly expanding my knowledge, honing my skills, and contributing to the advancement of technology in meaningful ways.</p>
